        Congratulations! You are one step closer to creating your next large scale Javascript application!
        Following sections briefly describe the component samples we have implemented for your reference.

<div class="portlet-blue">
    <div class="title">
        <span>Samples in Product Module A</span>
    </div>
    <a href="#clickcounter" class="text-solid">Click Counter</a>
    <div class="content">
        provides an extremly simple adaptation of knockoutJS <a
        href="http://knockoutjs.com/examples/clickCounter.html" target="_blank">Click Counter example</a>.
        In addition, we added a lottery component to demonstrate inter-component interactions via events.
    </div>
    <br/>
    <a href="#departments" class="text-solid">Knockout MVVM</a>
    <div class="content">
        shows a bit more complex usage of knockoutJS’s MVVM
        architecture and its data bindings. The data for this panel is loaded from the server
        through AJAX calls. This component is an adaptation of KnockoutJS
        <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/examples/betterList.html" target="_blank">Better List example</a>.

    <div class="title">
        <span>Samples in Product Module B</span>
    </div>
    <a href="#sales" class="text-solid">Complex Dashboard</a>
    <div class="content">
        Demonstrates the use of a shared view model across components. There are two views in
        this dashboard that use the same shared view model, which enables them to easily respond
        to each other without using events. In addition we use some UI widgets for graphs and trees
        in this sample.
    </div>
    <br/>
    <a href="#employee/all" class="text-solid">List-Detail panels</a>
    <div class="content">
        A demonstration of implementing a list view and the relavant detail view
        that use URL navigation to switch back and forth. All information is loaded from the server on-demand as JSON
        documents.
    </div>
    <br/>
    <a href="#todo" class="text-solid">Backbone TODO</a>
    <div class="content">
        Latest addition to BoilerplateJS due to the popular demand for
         <a href="http://backbonejs.org" target="_blank">BackboneJS</a> integration.
         We ported this component from Addyosmani's <a href="http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/dependency-examples/backbone_require/" target="_blank">  TODO example</a> without much changes to the original code.

        <span>Other bits and pieces</span>

    <div class="content">
    <p>
        We implemented theme support as a theme component that you will find at <i>'src/modules/baseModule/theme'</i>. 
        Try changing the theme via header, you will find the whole application layout responding as well. We strongly believe loose coupling is the key to maintainable and adaptable code. To demonstrate the point
        for the theme component we do not use knockoutjs or backbonejs but plain jQuery event bindings.
    </p>
    <p>
        For multilingual support we use RequireJS’s <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#i18n" target="_blank">i18n
        plugin</a>. Not all components on the sample have localized text, 
        but atleast you can see the effect on navigation menu.
