To use the optimizer Node.js (0.4.0 or later) should be installed.

To optimize the project,

1. Add the paths of the dependancies to the boilerplate.build.js (The current ones are for the basic framework)

2. Double click on optimizer.bat or optimizer.sh to run

The optimized project will be created in the current folder and will be named 'build' as configured in the boilerplate.build.js file. 
** It will not contain the server directory in the sample boilerplate code due to the fileExclusionRegExp in the boilerplate.build.js. When running samples if you need it, just copy it to the build location**
