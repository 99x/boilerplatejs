To use the optimizer Node.js (0.4.0 or later) should be installed.

To optimize the project,

1. Add the paths of the dependancies to the boilerplate.build.js (The current ones are for the basic framework)

2.Set the path in Boilerplate_optimizer.bat to the optimizer directory of the project

3.Double click on Boilerplate_optimizer.bat to run

The optimized project will be created in the same folder as the original project and will be named nutcoco-optimized-build as specified in the build file. It will not contain the server due to the fileExclusionRegExp in the boilerplate.build.js

Note - The command in Boilerplate_optimizer.bat is for windows environment.
