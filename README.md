![BoilerplateJS - JavaScript Reference Architecture](https://github.com/hasith/bpjsweb/raw/master/images/logo.jpg)

## Introduction ##
We wrote boilerplateJS to take the pain out of large scale Javascript/HTML5 product development. 
* BoilerplateJS is a collection of product engineering patterns, and a solid integration of industry-leading Javascript frameworks.
* It is NIETHER a website building tool NOR a utility library solving just a single consern (such as MVC). 
* BoilerplateJS is your own startup code to kickstart next large-scale javascript product. It is just that we did some basic coding and library integrations to make your life easy!

## Architectural Concerns - Large Scale Development ##
BoilerplateJS addresses following concerns you will have in large-scale javascript development:
* Structuring the codebase
* Best practices of OO + Functional programming
* Building a product suite with complex product module hierachy
* URL routing, browser history, back/forward buttons
* Self contained UI components
* JS Unit Testing
* Inter-module event messaging
* Localization support
* Minification, obfuscation and optimizations
* Documentation Generation
